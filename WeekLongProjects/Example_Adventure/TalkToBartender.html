"Look who's finally awake, seems you had a really rough night in the jungle's of Chult! You wandered in here last night with nothing to your name but serious head injuries and lots of blood bleeding out of many cuts. I called the doctor immediately and they fixed you up but it seems from your face you have forgotten what happened… well no matter, get back on your feet adventurer, the treasures of Chult don’t find themselves"</p>

    <p>As you step outside you are greeted by the wonderful Port Nyanzaru as you are almost runover by the dino races happening in the streets. Crowds of residents stand pressed up against the road's buildings so as to not get hit themselves as they watch and cheer on their dinosaurs in the dinosaur race!</p>

    <p>"Oh my the wonders of the jungle, there are many unclaimed treasures out in the jungle but I assume you are interested in the ring of winter. The ring of winter is a legendary but long lost ring forged in the mountains of the ice giants. That legendary ring was said to be able to freeze entire oceans and cause avalanches the size of empires, but since the frost giant's leader who attempted to raid this island mysteriously disappeared it has been lost to the jungle. If you are looking to learn more, Artus, the rider of the velociraptor was the combat general turned adventurer when the ring went missing, if anyone would have information on it it would be him"</p>

    <p>"Ah another adventurer looking for the long lost Ring Of Winter, I was like you, filled with vigor ready to be the one to claim most powerful ring in existence. But I have gotten old since then and I haven't been able to adventure. If you would like to find the ring of winter I suggest you start at the place the ice giant king went missing, the forbidden city of Omu. That was the last place I pushed the ice giant king's army to, before they all mysteriously disappeared"</p>

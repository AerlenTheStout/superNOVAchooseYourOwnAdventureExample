This is the page where you can read about all the comics me and my freinds make! Be sure to also read the other pages for facts about the making of the comic books as well!</p>

    <p style="font-size: 40px; color: rgb(198, 63, 63); font-family: fantasy; background-color: rgb(244, 225, 178);">Ok, none of you know what these comics are because we haven't published them, but Gerald And cornstartch is one of my favoriotes.
        Two creepy kids named Gerald, and well, cornstartch, spend the night at their grandmother's. Only later on to start off a chain reaction that would destroy one thing after another until their grandmother's whole house is a pile of rubble!
        This book was hard to make, and soon I will hopefully start making copies.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 50px; color: khaki; font-family: fantasy; background-color: rgb(198, 63, 63);">2= The Dumbys</p>

        <p style="font-size: 40px; color: rgb(198, 63, 63); font-family: fantasy; background-color: rgb(244, 225, 178);">Ok, just to be clear, we spelled that wrong on purpose. We 100% know how to spell dumbees... This comic is the first comic me and my freinds ever made. It is about three dumb aliens, (who look like humans), that get exiled from their planet, (Smarty planet),
            and end up at Earth! But will their immesurable amount of annoyance get in their way?...Yes.
            We have gone through a million versions of making this book, but we always give up on it! Luckily, I am in the middle of working on one right now! And I might finish it soon! (As in, 3 years).</p>

            <p style="font-size: 50px; color: khaki; font-family: fantasy; background-color: rgb(198, 63, 63)">3= School Supplies</p>
            <p style="font-size: 40px; color: rgb(198, 63, 63); font-family: fantasy; background-color: rgb(244, 225, 178);">The School Supplies didn't really start out as a comic, in fact it still isn't really one. It is just something we made up in grade 4 or 5 at lunch or recess. But we have tried making comics of it, so therefore I'm classifing it as a comic. It's about talking school supplies of all sorts! But they are not all good. In fact most of them are not good. But Bright Spots and Sharpie are! And they will do anything to save the fate of their desk! </p>

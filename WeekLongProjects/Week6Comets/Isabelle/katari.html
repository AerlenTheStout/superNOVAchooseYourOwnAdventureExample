        <p style="color: #3b220a;">Katari is a very hotheaded and passionate dragon, who met Ara in her quest of rebellion.</p>
        <p style="color: #3b220a; background-color: #955e36;">Age : 15</p>
        <p style="color: #3b220a; background-color: #955e36;">Species : Dragon</p>
        <p style="color: #3b220a; background-color: #955e36;">Magic type : Fire</p>
        <p style="color: #3b220a;">Katari can be very particular about who she works with and who she trusts. She judges others based on wether or not they can help her in her goals, though she does have space for her personnal life on the side. Her copper hair is very curly and falls mid-way down her back. She usually appears in a human-like form, but she can transform into a dragon if she needs to.</p>

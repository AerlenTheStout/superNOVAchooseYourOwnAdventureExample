    <h1>Messi History</h1>
    <h2>Early Days</h2>
    <p>Lionel Andres Messi was born in Rosario, Argentina on June 24th, 1987.</p>
    <p>He grew up in a poor house-hold, and didn't have things to eat for </p>
    <p>some days. One day, he went to a soccer game with his grandma</p>
    <p>and asked to play in the game. They let as it was a young age group</p>
    <p>They let him play and he rocked it. He dribbled past many players,</p>
    <p>he scored many goals. The coach was impressed and allowed him to join</p>
    <p>the team. The team he joined was Newell's Old Boys, a soccer team based</p>
    <p>in Rosario. He played their for many years, climbing the ranks and always</p>
    <p>impressing. He always scored many goals and won many tropies there.</p>
    <p>One, day though disaster struck, and doctors diagnosed Messi with a disease.</p>
    <p>The diseases was Growth Hormone Deficency. To fix it, doctors said they had</p>
    <p>to give him injections every day, but the family couldn't afford it, but that's </p>
    <p>when Messi's work paid off. FC Barcelona, a proffesional team in Spain, offered</p>
    <p>to pay for his medicine on 1 condition, that he joined the academy. The desicion was</p>
    <p>simple, he had to hop on a flight to Barcelona, Catalonia.</p>
    <h2>Academy days</h2>
    <p>Once at La Masia, Messi quickly stood out despite his small size and quiet nature. </p>
    <p>His exceptional dribbling, vision, and goal-scoring instincts made him a standout among a</p> 
    <p>talented group of players, including future stars like Gerard Piqué and Cesc Fàbregas.</p> 
    <p>The coaches at La Masia helped him adapt to Barcelona’s unique playing style, based on quick</p> 
    <p>passing, movement, and tactical intelligence—what would become known as tiki-taka. By the age of 16,</p> 
    <p>Messi was already training with the first team, and in 2004, he made his official senior debut for Barcelona.</p> 
    <p>His years at La Masia laid the foundation for his legendary career, instilling in him not just technical skill but</p> 
    <p>also humility, discipline, and a deep understanding of the game.</p>

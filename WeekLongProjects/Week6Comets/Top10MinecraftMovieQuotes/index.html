    <p style="font-size: x-large; color: aliceblue;"> #1. "This! is a Crafting Table"</p>
    <img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/003/043/529/247.jpg" alt="CraftingTable" width="350" height="260">   
    <p style="color:aquamarine; font-size: larger">This quote is uttered by Jack Black's Steve when he's introducing the elements of the Minecraft's Overworld to Jason Momoa's Garett 'The Garbage Man' Garrison and some kid named Henry who doesn't even really need to be in the movie.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: x-large; color: aliceblue;"> #2. "I... am STEVE"</p>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/magicmush/images/a/a9/False_Imposter.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1200?cb=20240924115517" alt="Steve" width="400" height="225">
    <p style="color: aquamarine; font-size: larger">How to NOT introduce yourself to people. I guess Steve's too unique to care that people think he sounds like someone with MCS (Main Character Syndrome).</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: x-large; color: aliceblue;"> #3. "Flint and Steel"</p>
    <img src="https://minecraft.wiki/images/thumb/AMCM_Flint_and_Steel.jpeg/1200px-AMCM_Flint_and_Steel.jpeg?b5263" alt="FlintandSteel" width="400" height="220">
    <p style="color: aquamarine; font-size: larger;">Another quote by Steve, in probably the first five minutes of the movie when he and his dog, Dennis, find a ruined Nether portal. And a conveniently placed chest, for some reason.</p>

    <p style="font-size: x-large; color: aliceblue;"> #4. "Steve's Lava Chicken Song"</p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41O_MydqxTU">Link to the music video here</a> 
    <p style="color: aquamarine; font-size: larger">Now, this one is less of a quote and more of a certified meme. HOWEVER, one of Steve's multiple quotes from this movie is: 'Ever wonder what happens when you mix hot lava and CHICKEN?' He says this right before this banger starts playing. Apparently, this song somehow made it onto the Billboard Top 100 (made it to #78), even though it was only about 30 seconds long, making it the shortest song to hit the Top 100.</p>

    <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size:x-large;"> #5. "The Nether"</p>
    <img src="https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/minecraft-movie-jack-black-nether-portal.jpg?q=70&fit=contain&w=1200&h=628&dpr=1" alt="The Nether" width="400" height="200">
    <p style="color: aquamarine; font-size: larger">You get the gist by now; All of these Minecraft Movie Quotes are gonna be said from Steve. If you can guess where Steve just arrived when he says this, you get a prize! ... ... ...If you said the Nether, good job! You're a real smart cookie, you are.</p>

    <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size: x-large;"> #6. "As a child, I yearned for the mines"</p>
    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/w_VsoWpdKO4AAAAM/sigma.gif" alt="YearnForTheMines" width="270" height="220">
    <p style="color: aquamarine; font-size: larger">The first meme of the movie, and it's referencing a meme from half a decade ago. This film is something else, man. What else can I say? He yearned for the mines.</p>

    <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size:xx-large;"> #7. "CHICKEN JOCKEY" ðŸ—£ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgflip.com/9vp0gr.gif" alt="CHICKENJOCKEY">
    <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=adde10145c0e0ebd&rlz=1C1ONGR_enCA1163CA1170&q=chicken+jockey&source=lnms&fbs=AIIjpHz30rPMyW-0vSP0k1VTNmO_kCOARpjPjQRkBWH2HwUIz5XUSIJvSK0oms7XOxizDlksSxoUg32ymGSEgM5nnZAUMufphj-RCYzWdYYKgzspi6GP9RcF0jmdK6KfByTrAEreWTVcv9mSjL9jbj5H5TJGgad2iAQDFLG9E29j0VjgWhhe-wvkKxpRZlQvYFrz3W3_tIibOWYaiYztKAdYj8XtDOiwP_79alhXd0yf04ACcnBXK3g&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiwsO3i4fiOAxUPHDQIHVkmPGIQ0pQJegQICxAB&biw=1280&bih=585&dpr=1.5#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:3dbe479d,vid:RjKGhWY9VUo,st:0">Click here to see Chicken Jockey</a>
    <p style="color: aquamarine; font-size: larger">This is the best quote in the entire movie, not even close. Chicken Jockey sent people who watched it into frenzies, throwing drinks and loads and loads of popcorn at the screen like complete maniacs. Never in my LIFE has there been a louder reaction to something someone says in a film. When I watched the movie, I didn't see any popcorn get thrown around, but it was still very loud in there. Like, holy shhhhhrimp. Calm down.</p>

    <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size: x-large;"> #8. "Water Bucket! RELEASE!"</p>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQhexa2EUX0yJ61gnv1oyPRk5KpXU4jQe16Yzmmc6k3c2fl2HBxy9EFp9r6Ve7GLv1unn4&usqp=CAU" alt="WaterBucket" width="360" height="220">
    <p style="color:aquamarine; font-size: larger">Now, don't take this quote out of context. Steve's just trying to cushion their fall with Dream's Water Bucket Clutch trick :D He's lived in this world for so long, he knows how to escape death by using a bottle of water. True gamer moment.</p>

    <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size: x-large;"> #9. "Steve's Stash"</p>
    <img src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1BBwjb.img?w=512&h=288&m=4&q=94" alt="Stash" width="400" height="250">
    <p style="color: aquamarine; font-size: larger;">Steve has roamed the overworld for so long, man. He has TNT, fireworks (which are apparently also good for propulsion), diamond armor (full set), Boots of Swiftness, and, of course, Blades for Days.</p>

    <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size: x-large;"> #10. "First we mine, then we craft. LET'S MINECRAFT!"</p>
    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/dUzs8wcLJaEAAAAM/a-minecraft-movie-minecraft-movie.gif" alt="Title Card" width="300" height="250">
    <p style="color: aquamarine; font-size: larger;">'Mom, get the camera! The funny overweight man on the screen said the name of the movie!' type of quote. I decided to put this one at the end of the list because this was one of the funniest name-drops of the title of a movie ever.</p>

    <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size: xx-large;">Thank you for taking a couple minutes of your life from you, taking a good read at this list of goofy quotes from a goofy movie. Have a good day :)</p>

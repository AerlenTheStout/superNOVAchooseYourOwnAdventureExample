    <p style="font-size: 20px; color:black">
        The 911 system was created to provide a quick and easy way for people to call for 
        help in emergencies. Before this system, people had to remember different numbers for police, fire, and 
        medical emergencies, which could be confusing and time-consuming.
    
    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: black;">
        The first 911 call happened in 1967. Before that There was 
        a need for an easier and shorter way to call for help. In 1957 the national Association of Fire Chiefs
        recomended a single number for reprting fires but for whatever reason the request was ignored.
        Then, in 1967, President Lyndon B Johnson's Commision of Law Enforcement and Adminisration of Justice also
        recommened a single number for emergencies. In 1968 AT&T (American Telephone and Telegraph.) annouced that
        911 woud be the offical emergency line number.</p>
     <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Eventually Canada adopted 911 with the first call in London, Ontario.
        Then the first Centralized Call Center: Montreal's 911 Emergency centre opened in 1985.
